# Hello World ðŸ‘‹  I'm [Nicholas Wertz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-wertz-345082b9/) 

### My name is [Nicholas Wertz,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-wertz-345082b9/) and I am a Data Scientist specializing in predictive models utilizing machine learning. I am a graduate of the Flatiron School's Data Science training program and I am experienced in Python, SQL, advanced mathematics, machine learning, data sorting, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
<br/>

## Here are some of the projects I am the most proud of:

### - [Speech Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/njw27/Speech_Emotion_Recognition_SER) - Capstone project for the Flatiron School
- In this project, I designed a Convolutional Neural Network model to identify emotion in speech from audio clips, utilizing keras
    - Converted all audio to spectrograms for 5 emotional classes, using the librosa Python package
    - Achieved 74% multi classification accuracy with minimal loss, applying kerasâ€™s ImageDataGenerator
    - Obtained an F1 Score of 84% for the sleepiness emotional class, employing scikit-learn
<br/>

### - [Twitter Sentiment Analysis of Apple and Google for AT&T](https://github.com/njw27/Apple-Google-Sentiment-Analysis) - Collaborative project for the Flatiron School
- For this project, our team investigated public sentiment of products from twitter messages, using Pythonâ€™s natural language toolkit
    - Determined which company had more positive public sentiment, utilizing pandas and matplotlib on the provided data
    - Produced an ensemble predictive model, combining Multinomial Naive Bayes and a Random Forest Classifier
    - Forecasted the sentiment in tweets using this model, concluding that the client should stock more Apple products
<br/>

### - [Water Well Functionality for the Tanzania Ministry of Water](https://github.com/njw27/Supervised-ML-For-Tanzanian-Water-Wells) - Collaborative project for the Flatiron School
- For this supervised machine learning project, the team produced a predictive model for the functionality of water wells in Tanzania, primarily utilizing scikit-learn
    - Inventoried and cleaned all data, removing any redundant features for modeling, using Pythonâ€™s pandas library
    - Constructed an ensemble model, integrating a decision tree classifier, logistic regression, and a KNN algorithm
    - Reached an accuracy of 81% and a precision of 82% with the final optimized version of the model
<br/>
